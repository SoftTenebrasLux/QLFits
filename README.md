QLFits 2
========

QLFits is a OSX Quicklook plugin for FITS (Flexible Image transport System) files (used by astronomers worldwide to store and share their data.)

It has been originally developed by CÃ©dric Foellmi (Soft Tenebras Lux). 

[Direct download](http://www.softtenebraslux.com/download.php?software=qlfits) (from the SoftTenebrasLux' website).

It is released open source under the [GNU General Public Licence](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_General_Public_License).

The following command line is run at the end of the Xcode build phase to ensure the QuickLook daemon is restarted:

    /bin/sh qlmanage -r
    
Once done, you can enjoy seeing the content of your FITS files directly in the Finder!
